A web-game where each time the system generates a random number(between 1 - 20) and the player has to guess to guess that number.
Initially a max of 20 guesses are given to the player and for each wrong guess, score/chance to guess the number will get deducted.
As soon as the player guesses the number, the highest score will get updated to the current score and the player wins the game.
